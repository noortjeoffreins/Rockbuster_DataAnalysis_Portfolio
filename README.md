# üë©‚Äçüíª Streaming into the Future: A Portfolio Case Study
_A data analysis informing the launch strategy of an online streaming service for the fictional movie rental company Rockbuster Stealth LLC, using a dataset designed for educational purposes by the educational institute._

üí° **CONTEXT**
This exercise as a student of a Data Analytics Career Program was all about building skills in SQL and Relational Databases. Inspired by a typical data analyst‚Äôs scenario, the project required balancing ad-hoc data requests while focusing on gathering insights to inform the overall launch strategy. 

üìä **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
In this case study, I identified a critical gap between Rockbuster's market potential and the dominance of online streaming services. By analyzing analog movie rental data, I highlighted the challenge of competing with highly personalized streaming platforms. My strategy, "Slow Streaming: Experience the Nostalgia of Vintage Viewing, on Demand," presents a unique, data-driven approach to differentiate Rockbuster and drive growth. My efforts culminated furthermore in a data-driven marketing campaign aimed at reactivating existing customers and engaging new audiences with their movie memories.

## üéØ **My Key Findings:**
* Rockbuster‚Äôs global reach extends to 109 countries, with merely 10 countries holding over 50% of the total customers.
* Escapist genres like Sci-fi, Games, and Travel receive the highest average customer ratings, yet comprise the lower half of our inventory volume.
* Key markets have more comprehensive data, while top spenders and viewers are primarily located in global regions.

## üöÄ **Summary of Recommendations:**
* Expand the escapist inventory where customer ratings are highest, and stock is lowest.
* With over a third of total turnover, make APAC your priority region.
* Determine if there are common underlying factors that influence the regional success of both North America and LATAM.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è **Portfolio Highlights**
This project highlighted how my language-learning skills extend to coding. SQL felt both accessible and structured, and its 'coding with words' approach made the learning curve empowering and rewarding. What I enjoyed most about learning SQL:
* **Creativty & Structure:** Coding in SQL enables me to channel my creativity by turning abstract ideas and unexpected connections into structured, actionable queries.
* **Flexibility & Speed:** SQL's flexibility and fast processing allow me to quickly test more hypotheses, perfectly aligning with my inquisitive nature.
* **Problem Solving:** Working with SQL and relational databases enhanced my ability to effortlessly switch between big-picture thinking and detailed problem-solving.

Additionaly, my strong visual thinking and commitment to clear communication were key in developing a comprehensive data dictionary, where I created focused 'partial ERDs' that highlight key connections for enhanced clarity.

üîó **PROJECT DELIVERABLES**
In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive launch strategy informed by data analysis, including insights and visualizations. It also contains a detailed data dictionary and a selection of key SQL queries. Additionally, I have linked to Tableau visualizations that I created and published below.
